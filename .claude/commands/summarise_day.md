# Daily Work Summary Analysis

Analyze development work patterns, achievements, and activities for **$ARGUMENTS** using multiple data sources and present comprehensive insights with **CONCRETE TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS**.

## Phase 1: Data Collection & Time Tracking

### 1.1 Run Dashboard Script for Fresh Data
First, generate the most up-to-date analysis:

```bash
cd /home/rolf/fuzzy-ops/tools/time-tracker-integration
./dashboard.sh
```

**Expected Output**: Fresh time tracking data with comprehensive activity breakdown

### 1.2 Run Targeted Time Tracker Analysis
Execute the time tracker for the specific date:

```bash
uv run src/time_tracker.py --start "$ARGUMENTS" --end "$ARGUMENTS"
```

**Expected Output**: CSV and JSON files with session data, project breakdowns, and service usage statistics

### 1.3 Extract Claude Work Insights  
Run the JSONL extraction script on all available Claude projects:

```bash
# Find all Claude project JSONL files for the target date
find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl" -newermt "$ARGUMENTS" ! -newermt "$(date -d "$ARGUMENTS + 1 day" +%Y-%m-%d)" | head -10

# Extract insights from each relevant file
for file in $(find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl" -newermt "$ARGUMENTS" ! -newermt "$(date -d "$ARGUMENTS + 1 day" +%Y-%m-%d)" | head -5); do
    echo "=== Analyzing: $file ==="
    python extract_claude_work_insights.py "$file" "$ARGUMENTS"
done
```

**Expected Output**: Detailed session analysis including:
- Git branches worked on
- Working directories 
- User requests and assistant responses
- Token usage and interaction complexity

### 1.4 Check Git Activity Across All Repositories
Examine git commit activity across key repositories:

```bash
# Check current repository (time-tracker-integration)
echo "=== Current Repository Git Activity ==="
git log --oneline --since="$ARGUMENTS 00:00" --until="$ARGUMENTS 23:59" --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s" --date=short

# Show detailed changes for each commit in current repo
for commit in $(git log --since="$ARGUMENTS 00:00" --until="$ARGUMENTS 23:59" --pretty=format:"%h"); do
    echo "=== Commit: $commit ==="
    git show --stat $commit
done

# Check other key repositories if they exist
for repo in ~/Projects/political_template ~/Projects/ai_augmentation ~/fuzzy-ops; do
    if [ -d "$repo/.git" ]; then
        echo "=== Git activity in $repo ==="
        cd "$repo"
        git log --oneline --since="$ARGUMENTS 00:00" --until="$ARGUMENTS 23:59" --author="$(git config user.name)" --pretty=format:"%h %ad %s" --date=short
        
        # Show detailed changes for each commit in this repo
        for commit in $(git log --since="$ARGUMENTS 00:00" --until="$ARGUMENTS 23:59" --author="$(git config user.name)" --pretty=format:"%h"); do
            echo "=== Commit in $repo: $commit ==="
            git show --stat $commit
        done
        echo ""
    fi
done
```

**Expected Output**: List of commits across all repositories with messages and detailed file change statistics

## Phase 2: Data Analysis Files to Examine

### 2.1 Time Tracking Data
**Primary Files**:
- `data/time_tracking_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` - Structured session data

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANALYSIS:

1. **ALWAYS run `./dashboard.sh` first** for fresh data
2. **Extract concrete details from git commits** using `git show --stat`
3. **Analyze Claude JSONL sessions** for specific technical problems solved
4. **Focus on deliverables, not just time spent**
5. **Include exact file names, line counts, and technical changes**
6. **Cross-reference git commits with Claude session activities**
7. **Provide specific business/technical impact for each achievement**

**Remember**: The goal is to document WHAT WAS BUILT/FIXED/DELIVERED with precise technical details, not just summarize time allocation.
