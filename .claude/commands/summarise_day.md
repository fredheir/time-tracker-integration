# Daily Work Summary Analysis

Analyze development work patterns, achievements, and activities for **$ARGUMENTS** using multiple data sources and present comprehensive insights.

## Phase 1: Data Collection & Time Tracking

### 1.1 Run Time Tracker Analysis
Execute the time tracker to collect session data:

```bash
cd /home/rolf/fuzzy-ops/tools/time-tracker-integration
uv run src/time_tracker.py --start $ARGUMENTS --end $ARGUMENTS
```

**Expected Output**: CSV and JSON files with session data, project breakdowns, and service usage statistics

### 1.2 Extract Claude Work Insights  
Run the JSONL extraction script on all available Claude projects:

```bash
# Find all Claude project JSONL files for the target date
find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl" -newermt "$ARGUMENTS" ! -newermt "$(date -d "$ARGUMENTS + 1 day" +%Y-%m-%d)" | head -10

# Extract insights from each relevant file
for file in $(find ~/.claude/projects -name "*.jsonl" -newermt "$ARGUMENTS" ! -newermt "$(date -d "$ARGUMENTS + 1 day" +%Y-%m-%d)" | head -5); do
    echo "=== Analyzing: $file ==="
    python extract_claude_work_insights.py "$file" $ARGUMENTS
done
```

**Expected Output**: Detailed session analysis including:
- Git branches worked on
- Working directories 
- Tool usage patterns
- User requests and assistant responses
- Token usage and interaction complexity

### 1.3 Check Git Activity
Examine git commit activity across key repositories:

```bash
# Check fuzzy-ops repository
cd /home/rolf/fuzzy-ops
git log --oneline --since="$ARGUMENTS 00:00" --until="$ARGUMENTS 23:59" --author="$(git config user.name)"

# Check other key repositories if they exist
for repo in ~/Projects/political_template ~/Projects/ai_augmentation; do
    if [ -d "$repo/.git" ]; then
        echo "=== Git activity in $repo ==="
        cd "$repo"
        git log --oneline --since="$ARGUMENTS 00:00" --until="$ARGUMENTS 23:59" --author="$(git config user.name)"
    fi
done
```

**Expected Output**: List of commits with messages showing completed features, fixes, and improvements

## Phase 2: Data Analysis Files to Examine

### 2.1 Time Tracking Data
**Primary Files**:
- `data/time_tracking_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv` - Structured session data
- `data/time_tracking_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json` - Detailed JSON format
- `data/dashboard.html` - Visual analysis (if generated)

**Key Columns to Focus On**:
- `project` - Which projects were worked on
- `duration_hours` - Time spent per session
- `service` - Tools used (Claude, Cursor, Git)
- `commit_message` - Related git commits
- `interactions` - Intensity of work sessions

### 2.2 Claude JSONL Analysis Output
**Focus Areas**:
- **Session summaries**: Number of interactions, token usage
- **Git context**: Branches, working directories
- **Tool usage**: Which Claude tools were used most
- **User requests**: Actual problems being solved
- **Technical content**: Files modified, code changes

### 2.3 Dashboard Visualization
If available, examine:
- `data/dashboard.html` - Interactive charts and heatmaps
- Repository breakdown charts
- Service usage statistics
- Daily activity patterns

## Phase 3: Analysis & Presentation Instructions

### 3.1 Synthesize Data Sources
**Cross-reference the following**:
1. **Time tracker** session duration vs **Claude JSONL** interaction complexity
2. **Git commits** timing vs **time tracker** project focus
3. **Claude tool usage** patterns vs **actual code changes**

### 3.2 Structure Your Analysis Report

#### **Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)**
- Total productive hours tracked
- Primary project focus
- Major achievements completed

#### **Project Breakdown** 
For each project worked on:
```
**Project Name**: X hours, Y sessions
- **Primary Activities**: [Based on Claude requests and git commits]
- **Files Modified**: [Key files from git and Claude analysis]  
- **Technical Focus**: [Architecture, features, debugging, etc.]
- **Completion Status**: [Features completed, ongoing work]
```

#### **Development Workflow Analysis**
- **Tool Integration**: How Claude, Cursor, and Git were used together
- **Session Patterns**: Focused blocks vs scattered activity
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: Research, implementation, testing patterns

#### **Key Achievements**
Based on git commits and Claude context:
- **Features Completed**: Concrete functionality delivered
- **Technical Improvements**: Refactoring, optimization, bug fixes
- **Knowledge Work**: Research, analysis, planning activities

#### **Technical Deep Dive**
From Claude JSONL analysis:
- **Complex Problem Solving**: High token usage sessions
- **Code Quality Work**: Review, refactoring, standardization
- **System Integration**: Multi-service/module work

### 3.3 Presentation Guidelines

**For Management/Stakeholders**:
- Lead with business outcomes and completed features
- Quantify productive hours and project progress
- Highlight major technical milestones

**For Technical Teams**:
- Detail architectural decisions and code changes
- Explain tool usage patterns and development workflow
- Share insights about problem-solving approaches

**For Personal Review**:
- Analyze productivity patterns and tool effectiveness
- Identify areas for workflow optimization
- Note knowledge gaps or learning opportunities

### 3.4 Quality Indicators to Highlight

**High-Value Work Indicators**:
- Long, focused Claude sessions (>100 interactions)
- Multiple tool usage in single sessions
- Git commits with substantial changes
- Cross-project integration work

**Efficiency Indicators**:
- High ratio of git commits to time spent
- Consistent session patterns
- Tool-assisted problem solving
- Knowledge transfer between projects
